### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I started with a CSS Reset solution from Andy Bell, recommended by Kevin Powell.
I used both Flexbox and Grid for different layout situations.
I intentionally used various classes for DOM manipulation to deal with return type of both Obj and Obj[]
    .getElementById
    .getElementsByTagName
    .getElementsByClassName
